        "Almost a decade ago, Spotify had a [shuffling crisis](https://engineering.atspotify.com/2014/02/how-to-shuffle-songs/). Even though they were doing *theory optimal* shuffling, people weren't happy. Sure, the music was randomly shuffled, but it didn't **feel** randomly shuffled. Now why is that?\n",

        "Now perhaps after being primed with such a question, you're inclined to choose the left image, but our instinct is to think the right distribution is random even though it is much more uniform than random. It takes something more than randomness to spread points in a grid without forming any clusters. This desire to find patterns in random patterns isn't completely random, it's called [apophenia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apophenia#:~:text=Apophenia%20has%20also%20come%20to,as%20can%20occur%20in%20gambling.), and it's a thing all us silly little humans do.\n",
